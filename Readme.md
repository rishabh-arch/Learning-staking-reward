## At Main branch
- [Solidity by Examples(Very Important)](https://solidity-by-example.org/)

- [Block and Transaction Properties](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/introduction-to-solidity-228c)

- I made an example of grandfather Fortune contract.

## At Day2 branch
The contract allows only its creator to create new coins(different issuance schemes are possible).

Anyone can send coins to each other without a need for registering with a username and password, all you need is an Ethereum keypair.
### I am going to build a basic token contract
