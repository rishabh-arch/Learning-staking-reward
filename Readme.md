## At Main branch
- [Solidity by Examples(Very Important)](https://solidity-by-example.org/)

- [Solidity 0.8 (Smart Contract Programmer)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv9OmztShIw&list=PLO5VPQH6OWdVQwpQfw9rZ67O6Pjfo6q-p)

- [Block and Transaction Properties](https://dev.to/gbengelebs/introduction-to-solidity-228c)

- I made an example of grandfather Fortune contract.

## At Day2 branch
The contract allows only its creator to create new coins(different issuance schemes are possible).

Anyone can send coins to each other without a need for registering with a username and password, all you need is an Ethereum keypair.
### I am going to build a basic token contract

- [reference from youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chdYNPCC8ck&list=PLzb46hGUzitDd39YzB1YvZqeIXXtmBrHX&index=13)

## At Day3 branch
### Part 1
- so i have to clone git from a youtube channel reference
- [git clone https://github.com/01Clarian/defi-staking-app-starter.git](https://github.com/01Clarian/defi-staking-app-starter.git)
But you dont need to if you dont want to start configing the project.
- Then (Npm i) to install all the dependencies
- Then I add some folders inside src -> components,contracts,truffle_abis
- root->migrations->migrations.js
- after this i have to create truffle-config.js file inside root and add some configs
